# CalculeitorPP
Calculeitor++: The best GNU/Linux calculator you will get, made in C++, with love from a noob â™¥

This calculator is totally free (think of free as freedom, not free beer), you can modify it, sell it, share it with your friends, this calculator is compliant with the 4 liberties of free software.

# COMPILING
This calculator has already an out script to avoid compiling it, however you can compile it if you want. The mode to compile this calculator is with the command line (or your favorite editor), however using the command line you must use "g++ main.cpp -o <name of the out>", how you compile the program in your editor depends on which one are you using.

# USAGE
This calculator its extremely easy to use; just run the script to start the calculator, it will ask you for two numbers, after you give them, you will be asked for the option, and the calculator will do the job printing the result.

# FEATURES
Calculeitor++ is not an ordinary calculator, Calculeitor++ can do:
  1.- Tipycal aritmetichal operations, such as additions, substractions, multiplications and divisions.
  2.- Calculeitor++ is user friendly, and FSF compliant.
  3.- Calculeitor++ is capable of calculate POW with a handmade function (im REALLY proud of it), doing a great job at calculating potences.
  4.- More things comming!
# TO DO
  1.- Add themes to Calculeitor++.
  2.- Add a graphical interface (i don't know how to manage them, i would like to use GTK, however i think i need gtk --, or something idk)
  3.- Make more arithmetical operations compatible with Calculeitor++
  4.- Make a way to reset the Calculator only if the user wants to stop. (Currently working on it).
  
  I hope you enjoy my first "Project" in C++, i put "Project" Because i want to upload here to have a backup, and let people tell me what can i do better and what can i make to do a better calculator.
